RU Hacks 2021-Assignment Zoo
==================
## What this project does
Assignment Zoo is an online learning platform that motivates students from Grade 1-5 to complete their assignments through a rewarding system! Students can earn a badge every time they submit and/or do well on an assignment. Teachers are able to upload all of their assignments on Assignment Zoo for students to complete and set how many badges students should be earning throughout the school year. They can also assign how many badges a student needs to earn before they can unlock the ability to adopt virtual animal buddies called Progress Pets! 

## Why this project is useful
Ever since the pandemic hit, students have been forced to tackle the challenge of adjusting to online learning at home and it hasn’t been easy. During the pandemic, 42% of students indicated staying motivated was a major problem for them completing coursework online. Being at home introduces many distractions that hinder a students’ learning which decreases the overall engagement and motivation. Impressionable students from Grades 1-5 need academic structure, especially in their early years of learning to help develop and enrich their knowledge. However, they are lacking in confidence and structural support they need to succeed academically right now. This project will be help because with our user friendly interface, students will be attracted to the fun characters and kid friendly colours. Assignment Zoo is interactive, easy to use, and can help students stay organized with a calendar that highlights all of their assignment due dates by colour and corresponding subject. Students can visually see their completed and uncompleted assignments for each class, and track the badges that they have earned! They will feel accomplished and rewarded once earning their Progress Pets.

## How we built this 
First, we created a website layout on AdobeXD which includes all of the features that we want the website to have. Then, we coded the website on QOOM using HTML and CSS.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
We were able to learn an extensive amount of HTML and CSS, as well as familiarize ourselves with Bootstrap. Specifically, we learned a lot of the basic elements of HTML and CSS which include, formatting and inserting text, images and tabs, adding dividing elements, and changing font styles and sizes.  

## What is next for this project
We hope to incorporate JavaScript in Assignment Zoo to have more user interactions like logging in, purchasing pets, and creating a game where students can interact with the progress pets they have earned. We would also like to include a calendar feature to help students stay organized with their assignment and project due dates as well as include the visuals/pages from a teacher’s perspective.
