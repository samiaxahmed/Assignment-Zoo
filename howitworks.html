		<p><b>Teachers are able to upload all of their assignments on Assignment Zoo for students to complete, set how many badges students should be earning throughout the school year, and how many badges a student can earn before they can unlock the ability to adopt a pet. When students complete/do well on one assignment, they earn a badge. As students continue to earn badges, they can cash them in to redeem virtual animal buddies, called Progress Pets! Students can try to collect all of the animal friends throughout the year! A virtual game where students can play and interact with their pets is COMING SOON!</b></p>
